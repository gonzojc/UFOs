# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of the project was to improve the filter and dynamic table functionality for the website using JavaScript. Dana wants to see more in-depth analysis of the UFO sightings based on provided criteria that includes date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO that was seen.

## Results
The updated webpage provides the user the ability to easily refresh the searches based on the new criteria. There are several additional filters that allows the user to really drill down to specific UFO sightings. Search criteria can be filtered further by date, city, state, country, and UFO shape or a combination of any of those.

## Summary

The updated webpage is far more user friendly and refined compared to only being able to previously filter by date only.

One drawback to the new webpage might be the somewhat limited ability to searching by city. If there were no sightings for that city, then your search may seemingly turn up negative. One recommendation would be to add a proximity aspect to the search capability and say within (ex 10, 20, 50 miles) from CITY. Additionally,  recommend using the three letter trigraph for the country (USA vs US) to mitigate instances where the country and state may have the same two letter code and would skew search results.
